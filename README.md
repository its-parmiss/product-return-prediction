# Project: Predicting Product Returns

## Objective
Product returns are a significant cost for Parts Avatar. We want to proactively identify orders that have a high probability of being returned. By predicting these returns, we can flag high-risk orders for review, adjust marketing, or investigate potential issues with product listings.

Your goal is to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a product sold will be returned.

## The Challenge
The provided dataset is a simplified sample of historical sales. The primary challenge is not just to build a classifier, but to engineer meaningful features, select an appropriate model and evaluation metrics (especially given that returns are less common than successful sales), and interpret the model's predictions to provide actionable business insights.

## Dataset
* `data/sales_data.csv`: A sample of historical sales transactions.

## Your Tasks
1.  **Data Exploration & Feature Engineering:**
    * Perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data.
    * Engineer at least two new features from the existing data that you believe could be predictive of returns. For example, you might consider price-related features or interactions between variables.

2.  **Model Training & Evaluation:**
    * Build a machine learning pipeline that preprocesses the data, trains a classification model, and evaluates its performance.
    * **Problem-Solving:** Choose a model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) and justify your choice. Given the class imbalance (fewer returns), what evaluation metrics are most important (e.g., Precision, Recall, F1-Score, AUC-ROC)? Explain why accuracy alone is not a good metric here.

3.  **Interpretation & Reporting:**
    * Analyze the results of your best model. What are the most important features that predict a return?
    * Use techniques like feature importance plots or SHAP values to interpret your model's decisions.

4.  **Documentation:**
    * Update this `README.md` to be a comprehensive report of your project.
    * Include key findings from your EDA.
    * Describe your feature engineering process.
    * Justify your choice of model and evaluation metrics.
    * Present the final model's performance and, most importantly, provide **actionable recommendations** for Parts Avatar based on your model's insights. (e.g., "Our model shows that products in the 'Electronics' category over $200 have a high return probability. We should review the product descriptions for these items.").
    * Provide clear instructions on how to run your code.

## Evaluation Criteria
* **Problem-Solving & ML Concepts:** Your approach to feature engineering, model selection, and handling class imbalance.
* **ML Pipeline:** The quality and structure of your code for training and evaluation.
* **Model Evaluation & Interpretation:** Your choice of metrics and your ability to extract business insights from the model.
* **Communication & Reporting:** The clarity of your analysis and the actionability of your recommendations in the README report.
